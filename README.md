# learn-django
My repository for the django tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/)

## Why this on GitHub ?

I like to have a clean project and to work by functionnality. It can also serve to show that I really learned django. Also, I work with two computers (one at work and one at home), and it's more easy to share the file this way.

## Why Django ?

Python. This must be sufficient ?
Okay, in reality I have made in the past a little project in Django but I don't remember most of it. Today I have a little project to do at my work, and Django seems to be the perfect candidate. So I'm here, remaking the tutorial !

## How far am I ?

Finished the tutorial ! Now, I'm ready for my little project.
